        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to ZPhygienes, your trusted partner in maintaining cleanliness and hygiene in your
            personal and professional spaces. Founded in 2022 by Sellina Mthembu, ZPhygienes was born from
            a desire to help individuals and businesses achieve pristine environments without the hassle of doing
            it themselves. We specialize in a wide range of cleaning services, including deep cleaning for rugs,
            mattresses, couches, and car seats. Additionally, we cater to businesses, apartments, and homes,
            ensuring thorough and professional cleaning tailored to your needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            At ZPhygienes, we understand the demands of modern life. Balancing work and home responsibilities
            can leave little time for essential household chores. Inspired by this reality, we set out to create
            a solution for busy individuals who deserve to come home to a clean, refreshing environment.
            Our services are designed to provide peace of mind, allowing you to focus on what truly matters
            while we handle the mess.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            We aim to improve the lives of South Africans by offering reliable, efficient, and high-quality
            cleaning services. Beyond just cleaning, our goal is to promote hygiene and foster healthier,
            happier living and working spaces. With every service we provide, we take a step toward creating
            cleaner communities across the country.
